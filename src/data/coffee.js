        The chic Durham Hotel has a bank vault turned coffee bar in its lobby.
        The home of the coffee soda, definitely worth the trip! If your feeling
        especially fancy, add a shot of bourbon. After getting your coffee soda,
        take a trip to the rooftop lounge for a great view of downtown Durham.
